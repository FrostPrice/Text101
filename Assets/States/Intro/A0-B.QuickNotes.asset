    First thing I need to say to you is that
    the story is unfinished.

    I''m learning how to use Unity and the programming
    language C#. I know this game can be bad :(

    But I''d love to see some recommendations,
    of what can I do to improve my skill in making games.

    So if you have any
    thing to say, feel free to do it :)


    Thank you for the atention... And have
    Fun!
